## Structure:
## Task 1: Load the Data and Import Libraries
Load the dataset using pandas.
Import essential modules and helper functions from NumPy and Matplotlib & sklearn.
Explore the dataframe using the head().
## Task 2: Inspect the Data
Explore the dataframe using the shape, info() functions.
Check the null values
Get Statistical Overview using describe()
## Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
For this dataset, I used a histogram, correlation matrix, barplot(), lineplot(), piechart, pointplot(), scatterplot()
using Seaborn & Matplotlib to visualize the data
Used boxplot()/jointplot() to check outliers in data
## Conclution
Through this preliminary analysis, I would suggest to the company that they should revamp their membership program because clearly it is not very effective.
Based on the ratings, members are not any happier with service than non-members and they are only slightly more likely to spend more money. 
This should not be the case.
