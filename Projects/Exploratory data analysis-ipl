## Exploratory Data Analysis - IPL Dataset
Indian Premier League is one of the most attractive Leagues in India. So my interest in data analysis, as well as Cricket, makes me do exploratory analysis to make Insights.

Subjects

Data Structure
Before analyzing the dataset, it is mandatory to know the structure, by importing libraries like pandas,numpy

Data Cleaning and ordering
Data cleaning is a necessary task, to bring the accurate output. In python, it's to be noted that the character column, which has NA values, it'll not consider as NA.
Rather it'll count as another group with an empty title.
Data Visualization
By presenting the data in charts, the color factor in which we use is also to be considered.
In python there are many library providing color palette for visualization.
Here I use seaborn and matplotlib.pyplot libraries

## conclusion
After winning the toss, teams mostly prefer to field first rather than batting.
MI is having a more winning percentage across all IPL seasons.
Two new teams were included in IPL season 2011, that's why there's an in-line rise chart on that period.
Chennai had the potent bowlers and fielders, so that Team won the most number of matches with the margin of 50runs.
KKR had the strong batsmen, so that Team won the most number of matches with the edge of 5wickets, and you can also notice that there's no broader difference among the Teams
